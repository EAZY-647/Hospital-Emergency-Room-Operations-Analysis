Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Operations & Efficiency Analysis

📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of 9,216 patient encounters within a Hospital Emergency Room facility. Using Power BI and raw clinical data, this dashboard identifies operational bottlenecks and maps patient satisfaction against wait times to suggest improvements for hospital management.

🗝️ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Based on the analysis of the dataset, the current state of the ER is defined by these core metrics:

Total Patient Volume: 9,216 unique visits.

Average Wait Time: 35.26 minutes per patient.

Mean Satisfaction Score: 4.99 / 10.

Top Referral Department: General Practice (1,840 patients).

📂 Project Structure

Hospital Emergency Room Analysis.pbix: The primary Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard.

Hospital ER_Hospital ER.csv: The raw data file used for the analysis (9,216 records).

IEEE_ER_Full_Report.md: A detailed formal report of the findings.

📈 Analysis & Insights

Demographics: The analysis reveals a balanced gender distribution and identifies Adults (18-65) as the highest volume age group.

Operational Challenges: While the 35-minute average wait time is stable, the low satisfaction score (4.99) indicates a need for better patient communication.

Resource Misuse: A high volume of patients (over 1,800) are being referred to General Practice, suggesting the ER is frequently used for non-emergency issues.
